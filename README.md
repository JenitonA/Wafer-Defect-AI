# Wafer-Defect-AI

## Project Overview
This project leverages a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to detect and classify defects on semiconductor wafers.  
The notebook walks through **data loading, preprocessing, model building, and visualization**, preparing for training a defect classification model.  

### Why This Matters
Semiconductor wafers are the foundation of modern electronics.  
Detecting defects early:  
- Improves manufacturing yield  
- Reduces costs from faulty chips  
- Ensures higher product reliability  

Automating defect detection with deep learning helps scale up quality control advancement and allows for prolonging prime efficiency within semiconductors.
